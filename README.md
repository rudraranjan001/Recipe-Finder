Recipe Finder is more than just a search tool; it's a personalized digital cookbook. In a world full of recipe websites cluttered with ads and complex user interfaces, this application provides a clean, focused, and user-centric experience. Users can instantly search for thousands of recipes from TheMealDB API, view detailed instructions and ingredients, and create a personal account to curate their own collection of favorites.

The real power comes from the personalization features. Logged-in users can not only save recipes but also add their own personal notes—perfect for tracking modifications, substitutions, or cooking tips. This project was built from the ground up to demonstrate a full mastery of the MERN stack, including secure user authentication with JWT, a custom-themed and responsive UI with Material-UI, and a well-structured RESTful API.

        ```
    *   Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory and add the following environment variables. Replace the placeholder values with your own.
        ```env
        PORT=5000
        MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
        JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_jwt_key
        ```
    *   Start the backend server:
        ```sh
